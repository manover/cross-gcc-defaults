The debian/control file is not shipped in this repository. It must be generated
and only THEN will normal Debian tools like dpkg-buildpackage work.

When generating the control file, it is necessary to specify the architectures
we're interested in. For instance, one could do this:

 TARGET_LIST='armel armhf' debian/generate-control.pl 

To adjust the major version of gcc, or the list of packages that we generate,
tweak the variables at the top of debian/rules
